# Database Requirements

The database is structured around several tables, each representing a different aspect of the hotel management system. These tables include `COUNTRIES`, `CITIES`, `CATEGORIES`, `GUESTS`, `HOTELS`, `REVIEWS`, `ROOM_TYPES`, `ROOMS`, `RESERVATIONS`, `INVOICES`, `ROLES`, and `EMPLOYEES`.

The `COUNTRIES` and `CITIES` tables store geographical information about where hotels are located. The `CATEGORIES` table categorizes hotels based on certain criteria. The `GUESTS` table stores information about the guests who stay at the hotels, while the `HOTELS` table contains information about the hotels themselves. The `REVIEWS` table stores reviews left by guests for different hotels. The `ROOM_TYPES` and `ROOMS` tables store information about the different types of rooms available and the specific rooms within each hotel. The `RESERVATIONS` table keeps track of room reservations made by guests. The `INVOICES` table stores invoice information for each reservation. Finally, the `ROLES` and `EMPLOYEES` tables store information about the employees at the hotels and their roles.

Thie database is designed to simulate real-world operations of a hotel management system, providing a comprehensive learning experience in database design, normalization, SQL queries, and database management.
